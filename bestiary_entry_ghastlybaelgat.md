# Ghastly Baelgat  

**Scientific Name:** Umbra caprivis

**Description:**
The Ghastly Baelgat is a shadowy entity known for its eerie, dark presence in the southeastern region of Hallowfall. Resembling a wraithlike apparition, this sinister figure wanders silently through the darkness, its form casting a dark purple glow.

**Habitat:**
Southeast Hallowfall, where the mist perpetually hangs low in the early mornings and the terrain is scattered with gnarled trees and crumbling rock pillars. This secluded location is an ideal haunt for these shadowy specters.

**Diet:**
As a ghostly being, the Ghastly Baelgat does not consume physical food. It feeds on the fear and despair of lost souls, drawing strength from the negative emotions of its surroundings.

**Fun Facts:**
* The Baelgat is said to occasionally manifest in areas where significant historical events occurred, replaying haunting visual snippets of those moments in the surrounding fog.
* The Baelgat often leaves behind faint, arcane symbols in the fog that are said to be remnants of its past magical prowess. Arathi scholars have tried and failed to decipher their meaning.
* When near the Baelgat, travelers may hear faint, wailing whispers mixed with spectral music, as if the ghost is communicating through a symphony of sorrow and despair.
